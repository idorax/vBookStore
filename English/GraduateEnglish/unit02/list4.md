## `UNIT 02`-`LIST 4`

#### 41. Remember, my son, you have to work. Whether you handle a `pick` or a pen, a `wheel-barrow` or a set of books, `dig`ging `ditch`es or `edit`ing a paper, ringing an `auction` bell or writing funny things, you must work.
> 切记，年轻人，你必须工作。不管你手里是锄头还是笔，是手推车还是一套书，也不管你是挖沟还是编报，是按拍卖铃还是写有趣的东西，你都必须工作。

#### 42. `Competition` would never enter in. Conflict would be `eliminate`d, `tension` become a thing of the past. The stress of creation would be at an end. Art would no longer be troubling, but purely `celebratory` in its `function`s.
> 竞争将永远不会介入；冲突也将被消除；人们紧张的关系将成为过眼云烟；创造的重压将得以终结；艺术将不再惹人费神，其功能将纯粹是为了庆典。

#### 43. Anything can be `achieve`d through `focused`, `determinated` effort and self-`confidence`. If your life is not what you want to be, you have the power to change it, and you must make the changes on a `moment by moment` `basis`.
> 任何事情都能通过专注而坚定的努力和自信实现。如果生活不是你想要的那样，你就有能力去改变它，而且你必须在一个循序渐进的基础上改变。

#### 44. `Nourish` `disappointment`s with hope whenever it is needed, and always stay cool and shaded when you feel `irritated` or `heated`. `Trim` away `guilt` or `depression`, for they create `decay`, and `cultivate` with happy memories as often as every day.
> 在必要时，你要以希望来滋养失望；当你生气或愤怒时，要始终保持冷静。我们要修剪掉愧疚与沮丧，因为它们会导致衰败。并且我们要每天都用幸福的回忆来培育快乐的种子。

#### 45. Such a `cruel` truth it is. People who don't deserve a `terminal` illness get sick and die. Others have trouble follow them around like an `unruly` puppy. `Unfortunately`, there isn't a whole `lot` you or anyone else can do about this `reality`.
> 事实就是如此残酷，不该患晚期病症的人却患病离世。对另一些人而言，麻烦总像任性的小狗一样寸步不离。不幸的是，在这样的现实面前，你我能做的事情并不多。
