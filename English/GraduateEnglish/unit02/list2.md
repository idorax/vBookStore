## `UNIT 02`-`LIST 2`

#### 31. To store days as a `miser` does dollars, to make every hour bring me `dividend`s in specific results accomplished. To `steer` clear of `dissipation` and `guard` my health of body and peace of mind as my most precious `stock` in trade.
>  像吝啬鬼对待金钱那样对待自己的每一天，让自己的每个小时都能就已取得的特定成就而为自己带来“红利”。避免无谓的体力和精力消耗，保护身体健康和内心的宁静，并将它们作为这场交易最珍贵的“资本”。

#### 32. Faith is the `mysterious` `spiritual` touch which brings a `sacred` `dimension` to our life. Faith doesn't `abide by` rules. Unlike brief, it has nothing to do with `religion` and everything to do with following one's heart.
> 信念是一种神秘的心灵触动，它使我们的生命达到一个神圣的维度。信念不遵循规则。不用于信仰，信念与宗教毫无关系，而是顺着自己的心意去做每件事。

#### 33. Many details and `trifle`s in life appear to be `neglect`ed by us in a `bustling` `urban` life. Some people `atribute` it to the `fickle` `ambience` over the whole city. Some think that our passion has been **`iron`ed `out`** by `invariably` `tedious` life.
> 身在熙熙攘攘的都市里，我们很容易忽视生活的细节和琐事。一些人认为这是由于整个城市浮躁的氛围造成的，有些人则认为我们的激情已经被一贯单调乏味的生活抹平。

#### 34. `Happiness` is so much simple, one your center of `palm`, a match a hand can `grasp`; happiness is also very difficult, before your `heel`, a thousand mountains and rivers but `blunder` away because of not turning a head.
> 幸福是如此简单，它就在你的手心，一合手就能握住；幸福却又很难把握，虽然近在脚下，跨越千山万水却因没有转头而白白错失。

#### 35. Winners do not play "helpless", nor do they play the `blaming` game. Instead, they `assume` `responsibility` for their own lives. They don't give others a false `authority` over them. Winners are their own bosses and know it.
> 胜者既不会故作“无助”之态，也不会怨天尤人。相反，他们会对自己的人生负责。他们不会以权威之势凌驾于他人之上。胜者主宰自己的命运，并且能意识到这一点。
