## `UNIT 02`-`LIST 3`

#### 36. Fears, even the most basic ones, can totally destroy our `ambition`s. Fear can destroy `fortune`s. Fear can destory `relationship`s. Fear, if left `unchecked`, can destroy our lives. Fear is one of the many enemies `lurk`ing inside us.
> 恐惧，哪怕是最基本的恐惧，也能彻底粉碎我们的抱负。恐惧能毁灭命运，也能摧毁感情。如果不加以控制，它还能摧毁我们的生活。恐惧是潜伏在我们内心的众多的敌人之一。

#### 37. Your mind is your most important and `precious` `asset`. You must protect it and keep it clean, clear and focused on what you want, rather than allowing it to be `pollute`d by the negative `influence`s around you.
> 心灵是你最重要和最珍贵的资产。你必须尽力保护并保持它纯净清澈，使其专注于自己向往的事物，不让它受到周围消极因素的污染。

#### 38. On your way to success, you must keep your `direction`. It is just like a lamp, guiding you in darkness and helping you overcome `obstacle`s on your way. `Otherwise`, you will easily get lost or `hesitate` to go ahead.
> 在成功的道路上，你必须坚持自己的方向。它就像一盏明灯，在黑暗中指引着你，帮助你克服前行道路上的障碍。否则，你将很容易迷路或者犹豫不前。

#### 39. When you `sincerely` `compliment` a person or `extend` him a `courtesy`, he is going to receive a direct `benefit` and like himself better. It is impossible for you to make someone feel better and no feel better yourself.
> 当你真诚地赞美一个人或对他以礼相待时，他将立刻受益并会更加地喜欢自己。当你让别人感觉更好时，自己也会感觉更好。

#### 40. Lots of people face far more `significant` limitations that you do. They may be missing `limb`s or are born into `extreme` `poverty`. But no matter what the `limitation`, you will always find people whoe have overcome it.
> 很多人所面临的局限性要比你多很多，他们可能失去了四肢或者出生在极度贫寒的家庭。但无论是何种限制，你总能发现有人已经克服了它。
