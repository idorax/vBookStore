Sep 26, 2017 was a big day to me because I had a very unforgettable interview
with VMware while getting a fever with 38.5 centidegree. After that more than
5-hour interview, I am aware that I shall start walking down a brand new path
although I'm not young any more. Nobody can be an expert in a short time since
Rome was not built in a day.

Hence, *The TCP/IP Guide* is my first book to read with unruffled calm because
I'm always believing the common sense in the following:

1. First humiliation then be brave.
2. Still waters run deep.

Be good, do right. Just do it.
